# GeoWatch — Product Introduction

## What is GeoWatch?

GeoWatch is a **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) / AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** monitoring platform that tracks your brand's visibility across AI-powered search engines. It tells you whether AI engines like Google AI Mode and ChatGPT mention your brand when users ask relevant questions.

## Core Differences vs Competitors

The biggest differences between GeoWatch and other competitors:

1. **Most affordable multi-engine GEO monitoring**: Pro plan at $49/mo. Profound charges $399-499/mo for multi-engine plans (their $99 Starter only covers ChatGPT). AthenaHQ starts at $295/mo, Ahrefs Brand Radar at $828+/mo, Writesonic GEO at $249/mo. GeoWatch makes AI search monitoring accessible to indie makers, startups, and small teams.

2. **Laser-focused on AI visibility tracking**: Unlike Writesonic (content creation + SEO + GEO bundled) or Ahrefs (traditional SEO suite + add-on), GeoWatch does one thing extremely well — monitoring your brand mentions across AI search engines. No feature bloat.

3. **Simple app-based workflow**: Create an app (your brand), add keywords you want to track, hit "Run Monitoring", and see results. No complex onboarding, no 30-day data collection wait (like Writesonic), no enterprise sales calls.

4. **Keyword-centric monitoring**: Each app tracks specific keywords (e.g., "best database GUI tool"), and GeoWatch queries AI engines with those keywords to check if your brand appears in the AI-generated response.

5. **Real AI engine access, not API shortcuts**: ChatGPT monitoring uses a genuine ChatGPT Plus subscription running on clean US California residential IPs with conversation memory disabled. Google AI Mode monitoring uses the same methodology — real browser sessions through authentic residential IPs. This ensures monitoring results match what actual users see, unlike tools that rely on API endpoints or data center proxies.

6. **Dual-source tracking**: Currently monitors Google AI Mode and ChatGPT, with plans to add Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini.

7. **Citation and source analysis**: For each AI response, GeoWatch extracts not just whether your brand is mentioned, but also the cited sources that AI engines reference when generating answers.

8. **3-day free trial**: Users can try the full product for 3 days before paying. No credit card required for account creation — you only enter payment info when you're ready to subscribe.

## Pricing

- **Pro Plan**: $49/mo — Up to 3 apps, 10 keywords per app, daily AI monitoring, Google AI + ChatGPT, email reports
- **Business Plan**: $199/mo — Up to 10 apps, 10 keywords per app, real-time monitoring, all AI platforms, priority support, API access

Do NOT mention specific pricing numbers that may change — instead say "starting at $49/mo" or "affordable plans for startups and SMBs". The exact tier details above are for your reference.

## User Workflow

1. Sign up (Google OAuth) → Land on Dashboard
2. Create an App (your brand name + description)
3. Add Keywords (queries you want to track in AI search)
4. Subscribe (Pro or Business plan, with 3-day free trial)
5. Run Monitoring → GeoWatch queries AI engines with your keywords
6. View Results → See if your brand is mentioned, read AI responses, check cited sources
7. Receive email reports with monitoring updates

## Product Purpose

GeoWatch helps brands and marketers:

- **Track AI search visibility**: Know if Google AI Mode, ChatGPT, etc. mention your brand
- **Monitor competitors**: See which brands AI engines recommend for your target keywords
- **Identify citation sources**: Understand which websites AI engines use as sources — then optimize those
- **Measure GEO efforts**: Track improvement over time as you optimize content for AI engines
- **Stay ahead of the shift**: As search moves from "10 blue links" to AI-generated answers, visibility in AI responses becomes critical for customer acquisition
